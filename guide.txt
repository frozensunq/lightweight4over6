1. Introduction

TC - lwAFTR & DHCPv4-over-IPv6 Server 
	Components: DHCP Server (Based on isc-dhcp 4.2.3); Tunnel Module
TI - lwB4 & DHCPv4-over-IPv6 Client
	Components: DHCP Client (Based on dhcpcd 5.2.10); CRA; Tunnel Module

Tunnel modules in both TC & TI are kernel modules based on linux kernel 2.6.32.

The codes in TC/ and TI/ should run in two different linux 2.6.32 hosts. Global IPv6 address should be configured in both hosts.

2. TC Configuration

2.1 Set up tunnel module

In the directory of TC/tunnel:
	make
	sudo ./load
	
TC/tunnel/load is the load script. It will set up a virtual interface named "4over6". Modify the IPv4 address in it if necessary.
TC/tunnel/unload is the unload script.

2.2 Run DHCP Server

In the directory of TC/dhcp:
	./configure
	make
	
TC/dhcp/server/dhcpd.conf is a sample configure file contains 58.205.200.0/24. The port set mask is 0xF800, so each client will get 2048 ports.
TC/dhcp/server/open4v6.sh is a sample load script of dhcp server.
	"-4v6" indicates DHCPv4-over-IPv6 mode;
	"-4v6interface 4over6" indicates each IPv4 address to be allocated must be in the same subnet with 4over6's IPv4 address. You can change it to "-4v6interface eth0" if you like.
	"eth1" is the real interface DHCP Server listens on.
	
3. TI Configuration

3.1 Compile

In the directory of TI/:
	make
	
3.2 Run

TI/start is the load script. Modify "LOCAL_IPV6_ADDR" and "REMOTE_IPV6_ADDR" to actual addresses.

In the directory of TI/:
	sudo ./start
